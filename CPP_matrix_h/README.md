#CPP_matrix_h

This folder contains my implementation of
matrix library, written in CPP programming language.

The main purpose of this library is to provide C with
the ability to work with matrices and to perform different
mathematical operations on them. Contrary to
my previous matrices project, written in C,
this project follows the principles of
Object Oriented Programming. Other than that,
it is similar to C_matrix_h
